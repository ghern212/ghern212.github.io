        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! My name is Grace Hernandez: Iâ€™m a first year a UC Riverside majoring in economics, with a potential double major in data science. Iâ€™m excited to see where my professional embarkment takes me. Some of my professional goals include becoming a master at coding, which Iâ€™m learning right now, and working at Google would be a huge dream of mine in terms of career paths. Some of my professional background includes working at DICKâ€™s Sporting Goods where I was employed as a front-end cashier for a year and a half, I also occasionally worked in apparel. I found that both of these role experiences at my past job helped to shape my interpersonal and customer service skills, which has enhanced my ability to engage with diverse individuals. I have a keen talent for managing various responsibilities within a retail setting and it has taught me the importance of efficiency, adaptability, and teamwork. All of these skills have proven to be fundamental in both my academic and professional pursuits. <br><br>

        During my first quarters at UC Riverside, I have been extremely involved in my school through organizations and community service. I am an executive member for 3 clubs, a dance cast member for my Filipino organizationâ€™s upcoming annual cultural night, and a delegate traveling to New York during spring break for an international Model United Nations conference. To say the least, having many responsibilities on top of being a full-time undergraduate student with a double major is a lot, but worth it. I have met so many wonderful people, but still have time to be reserved and complete my homework and extracurricular assignments. I think it is really fun that my coursework and clubs have a lot of overlap. A lot of the people I have met in the clubs Iâ€™m involved in have turned out to be in my classes, or live close to my dorms. Having this interdisciplinary agenda everyday broadens my knowledge but also makes it feel like this large campus is more tight-knit than it appears. <br><br>

        Looking ahead, I would love to work at a large tech company. My goals are centered around becoming a master coder and I believe I have the potential to accomplish this goal.  One of my ultimate career objectives is to work at Google, a company renowned for pushing the boundaries of technology and fostering an environment of continuous learning and innovation. I am driven by the desire to contribute to cutting-edge projects, collaborate with like-minded professionals, and make a tangible impact on the tech landscape.
